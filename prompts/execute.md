# Execute: Implement from Plan

## Plan to Execute

Read plan file: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Execution Instructions

### 0. Plan Verification (REQUIRED)

**Before executing ANY implementation, verify a plan exists:**

1. Check that `$ARGUMENTS` points to a valid plan file in `.agents/plans/`
2. If no plan file exists or path is invalid:
   - **STOP execution immediately**
   - Inform the user: "No valid plan found. Run `@plan-feature <feature-name>` first."
   - Do NOT proceed with ad-hoc implementation

**Why This Matters:**
- Plans prevent reactive problem-solving by surfacing issues during research
- The @plan-feature command's dependency analysis catches package/version issues upfront
- Platform-specific considerations are documented before implementation begins
- Demo vs production scope is pre-defined, preventing ad-hoc feature cuts

**Exceptions:**
- Bug fixes with clear scope (single file, obvious fix)
- Documentation-only changes
- Configuration updates

For anything else, **plan first, execute second**.

### 1. Read and Understand

- Read the ENTIRE plan carefully
- Understand all tasks and their dependencies
- Note the validation commands to run
- Review the testing strategy

### 2. Execute Tasks in Order

For EACH task in "Step by Step Tasks":

#### a. Navigate to the task
- Identify the file and action required
- Read existing related files if modifying

#### b. Implement the task
- Follow the detailed specifications exactly
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Include proper type hints and documentation
- Add structured logging where appropriate

#### c. Verify as you go
- After each file change, check syntax
- Ensure imports are correct
- Verify types are properly defined

### 3. Implement Testing Strategy

After completing implementation tasks:

- Create all test files specified in the plan
- Implement all test cases mentioned
- Follow the testing approach outlined
- Ensure tests cover edge cases

### 4. Run Validation Commands

Execute ALL validation commands from the plan in order:

```bash
# Run each command exactly as specified in plan
```

If any command fails:
- Fix the issue
- Re-run the command
- Continue only when it passes

### 5. Final Verification

Before completing:

- ✅ All tasks from plan completed
- ✅ All tests created and passing
- ✅ All validation commands pass
- ✅ Code follows project conventions
- ✅ Documentation added/updated as needed
- ✅ State persistence tested (for conversation/interactive features):
  - Verify data saves on user action
  - Verify data restores on component mount
  - Verify state clears appropriately (topic change, logout, etc.)

### 5a. Mobile-Specific Validation (for React Native apps)

If implementing mobile features, also verify:

- ✅ App launches on iOS Simulator without Metro bundler errors
- ✅ All native permissions prompt correctly (microphone, speech recognition)
- ✅ Offline mode works when API is unreachable (fallback to mock/cached data)
- ✅ Push notifications schedule correctly for spaced repetition
- ✅ AsyncStorage data persists across app restarts
- ✅ Date objects properly parsed after JSON.parse from storage
- ✅ Voice recording callbacks don't capture stale closure state

Reference: `.kiro/steering/mobile.md` for mobile-specific patterns and troubleshooting

### 6. Divergence Check (REQUIRED)

**Before completing, assess plan adherence:**

Calculate adherence: `(files created + files modified as planned) / total planned files`

**If adherence < 70%:**
1. STOP and document why divergence was necessary
2. Consider if a re-plan is needed with new constraints
3. Get explicit approval before proceeding with different architecture

**Architecture changes require documentation:**
- Switching from backend to frontend-only
- Removing planned integrations (Letta, external APIs)
- Changing data persistence strategy

---

### 7. Create Execution Report (REQUIRED)

**This is NOT optional.** Every execution MUST create an execution report.

Save to: `.agents/execution-reports/{feature-name}.md`

```markdown
# Execution Report: {Feature Name}

**Date**: {current date}
**Plan file**: {path to plan}
**Status**: Complete | Partial | Blocked

## Plan Adherence

| Metric | Planned | Actual |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Files to create | X | Y |
| Files to modify | X | Y |
| Tests to write | X | Y |
| Adherence | - | Z% |

## Files Created
- `path/to/file.ts` - Description

## Files Modified  
- `path/to/file.ts` - What changed

## Divergences

### Divergence 1: {title}
- **Planned**: What the plan specified
- **Actual**: What was implemented
- **Reason**: Why the change was necessary
- **Impact**: Effect on feature/architecture

## Validation Results
{output from validation commands}

## Skipped Items
- {item} - Reason for skipping

## Recommendations
- Follow-up work needed
- Technical debt created
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Captures institutional knowledge about implementation decisions
- Enables system reviews to identify process improvements
- Creates audit trail for architectural changes

---

## Output Summary

After creating the execution report, provide:

### Completed Tasks
- List of all tasks completed
- Files created (with paths)
- Files modified (with paths)

### Tests Added
- Test files created
- Test cases implemented
- Test results

### Validation Results
```bash
# Output from each validation command
```

### Execution Report
- Path to created execution report
- Adherence percentage
- Key divergences (if any)

### Ready for Commit
- Confirm all changes are complete
- Confirm all validations pass
- Confirm execution report created
- Ready for `/commit` command

## Notes

- If you encounter issues not addressed in the plan, document them in execution report
- If you need to deviate from the plan, explain why in execution report
- If tests fail, fix implementation until they pass
- Don't skip validation steps or execution report
